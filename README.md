This project predicts whether a bank customer will churn (leave) based on their profile data using Logistic Regression in Python.
---

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib)
- VS Code for development

---

## What I did
- Cleaned and prepared the data
- Built and evaluated a logistic regression model
- Tuned prediction threshold to improve recall (default vs custom threshold)
- Visualized precision and recall trade-offs

---

## How to run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install pandas| scikit-learn | matplotlib`
2. Run `bank-churn-ml.py`
3. Check the output predictions in `churn_predictions.csv`
